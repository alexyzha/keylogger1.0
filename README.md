# Keylogger
This is keylogger for educational purposes ONLY. It's coded for macOS using Objective-C using the Cocoa and Carbon libraries. While running it takes every detected input and sends it to a flask server (address omitted), where the inputs are stored. The code for the keylogger, the input translator, and the flask server are all here, as well as the compiled binary.
